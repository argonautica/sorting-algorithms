/**
 * Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place comparison sort. It can be seen as 
 * either a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) or sorting by 
 * insertion (insertion sort). The method starts by sorting pairs of elements 
 * far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements 
 * to be compared. Starting with far apart elements can move some out-of-place elements 
 * into position faster than a simple nearest neighbor exchange
